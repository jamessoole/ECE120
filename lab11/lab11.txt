Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
Line 14: starting adress was missing .ORIG
Line 17: adress for LD was incorrect, out of range
Line 19: extra comma
Line 30: adress for LD was incorrect, out of range
Line 32: BRzp was mislabeled as BRpz
Line 41: missing a .END
Line 355: ST location left as placeholder, should be RESULT


Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
OUTERLOOP: x300A
INNERLOOP: x300B
INPUT: x0014
ZERO: x0015
NEG!: x0016
Result; x0017



Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
Using labels is easier for a human to understand. They also don't have to change when inserting/removing lines.
