QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: I expect it to clear R2 and store the value 12 in its place.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program allows you to understand what it its doing (possibly incorrectly) at each stage. You can see the value of variables at each step, making it easier to fix the errors in your program.
